        <h1>Smart City</h1>
        <img src="smart city.jpg">
        <p>A city that uses technology to improve everyone's quality of life is called a smart city. The streets, buildings, and
        transit systems in a smart city are all linked to the internet and make use of technology to operate more effectively.
        For instance, buses or trains may arrive on time due to real-time tracking, and traffic signals may automatically adjust
        to lessen traffic congestion.</p><br>
        
      <p>  Sustainability and greenness are also key components of smart cities. Homes and buildings are powered by renewable
        energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels. Also, smart trash cans that detect when they are full and need to be
        emptied are available to help maintain a clean city.</p><br>
        
        
       <p> In a smart city, green areas like parks are created so that people can enjoy nature, and electric automobiles and
        self-driving cars contribute to pollution reduction. In general, smart cities seek to improve everyone's quality of life
        by making it simpler, cleaner, and more enjoyable.</p>

            <p>How smart technologies are used in houses to improve convenience, climate management, and energy efficiency is explained
            in Our Smart houses.
            Wind and solar energy are examples of renewable energy sources that power the city's grid.
            Composting, recycling initiatives, and smart bins are some of the methods used to reduce garbage.</p>
